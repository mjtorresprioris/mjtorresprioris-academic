Despite its prolifc growth, neurolinguistic research on phonemic sequencing has largely neglected
the study of individuals with highly developed skills in this domain. To bridge this gap, we report
multidimensional signatures of two experts in backward speech, that is, the capacity to produce
utterances by reversing the order of phonemes while retaining their identity. Our approach included
behavioral assessments of backward and forward speech alongside neuroimaging measures of
voxel-based morphometry, difusion tensor imaging, and resting-state functional connectivity.
Relative to controls, both backward speakers exhibited behavioral advantages for reversing words
and sentences of varying complexity, irrespective of working memory skills. These patterns were
accompanied by increased grey matter volume, higher mean difusivity, and enhanced functional
connectivity along dorsal and ventral stream regions mediating phonological and other linguistic
operations, with complementary support of areas subserving associative-visual and domain-general
processes. Still, the specifc loci of these neural patterns difered between both subjects, suggesting
individual variability in the correlates of expert backward speech. Taken together, our results ofer new
vistas on the domain of phonemic sequencing, while illuminating neuroplastic patterns underlying
extraordinary language abilities.
